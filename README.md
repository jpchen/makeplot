# Python Visualization Cheatsheet

I'm not a Python visualization expert. Far from it. So I compiled a notebook of all the plotting code I've ever written or used where I can copy and paste into new applications with minor modifications.  You can view it as an html [here](http://jonathanpchen.com/makeplot)

Most of it is machine learning visualizations since that's what I work with, and It's not exactly boilerplate (yet) but it's fairly reusable.

Pull requests welcome!
